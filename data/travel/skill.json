        "solution": "Based on the completed subtasks, we know Bob starts from Wuhan Railway Hotel at 2023-07-06 7:00, and he need to visit Yellow Crane Tower for 180 minutes, Tan Hua Lin for 180 minutes, Baotong Temple for 120 minutes. For efficiency, he doesn't have to start from the hotel every time. He should first go to Yellow Crane Tower from Wuhan Railway Hotel and then visit Yellow Crane Tower, go to Tan Hua Lin from Yellow Crane Tower and then visit Tan Hua Lin, ... \nWe should first use <action>execute_sql('''SELECT origin, destination, duration FROM in_city_transport\nWHERE origin in ('Wuhan Railway Hotel','Yellow Crane Tower','Tan Hua Lin', 'Baotong Temple') OR destination in ('Wuhan Railway Hotel','Yellow Crane Tower','Tan Hua Lin', 'Baotong Temple')''') to get traffic duration, and know that it takes 72 min from Wuhan Railway Hotel to Yellow Crane Tower, 55 min from Yellow Crane Tower to Tan Hua Lin, 47 min from Tan Hua Lin to Baotong Temple, etc.\nThen we need to arrange go_to_place() and visit(). If necessary, we can use execute_python to do the calculations and check the output of the code.\nThe final result could be as follows:\n1. Go to Yellow Crane Tower from Wuhan Railway Hotel. The departure_time is \"2023-07-06 7:00\" and the arrival time is \"2023-07-06 7:00\" + 72 min = \"2023-07-06 8:12\", which can be formatted as <plan>go_to_place(\"Wuhan Railway Hotel\", \"Yellow Crane Tower\", \"2023-07-06 7:00\", \"2023-07-06 8:12\")\"</plan>\n2. Visit Yellow Crane Tower from 8:12 to 11:12: <plan>visit(\"Yellow Crane Tower\", \"2023-07-06 8:12\", \"2023-07-06 11:12\")</plan>\nThen he may have lunch and rest until 14:00.\n3. Go to Tan Hua Lin from Yellow Crane Tower, depart at 14:00 and arrive at 14:00 + 55 min = 14:55. <plan>go_to_place(\"Yellow Crane Tower\", \"Tan Hua Lin\", \"2023-07-06 14:00\", \"2023-07-06 14:55\")</plan>\n4. <plan>visit(\"Tan Hua Lin\", \"2023-07-06 14:55\", \"2023-07-06 17:55\"), etc.\nFinally we can call <action>\"over()\"</action>\"\n"
